**Scope**: The User Detail APP is a robust web service designed to handle user management operations with various levels of access. It provides functionalities to retrieve details about users, each associated with different types of access permissions.

**Primary elements**: User Detail APP.

**Intended audience**: Everyone, technical and non-technical, inside and outside the software development team.

**Functional Requirement**
The User Detail APP should provide an API to retrieve details about users in the system. It should be able to handle the following cases:

* Receive a request to retrieve user details.
* If user details are provided, return details for the specified user.
* If no user details are provided, return details for all users in the system.
* If no users are present in the system, return an empty list.

***Success Scenarios***

* The user provides user details (e.g., Id, Name) to retrieve specific user details.
* The system successfully retrieves and returns details for the specified user.
* The user does not provide user details, and the system returns details for all users in the system.
* The system returns an empty list if no users are present in the system.

***Failure Scenarios***

* The user provides invalid or non-existing user details.
* The system encounters an error while retrieving user details.
* The API returns an error status code (e.g., 404) and a message indicating the reason for the failure in retrieving user details.

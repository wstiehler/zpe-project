* Creation of roles with associated permissions.
* Retrieval of role information including permissions.

***Success Scenarios***

* The Rope-APP allows creating new roles with associated permissions.
* Role information including permissions is successfully retrieved from the system.
* Roles are deleted from the system without encountering any errors.

***Failure Scenarios***

* The Rope-APP encounters an error while creating a new role.

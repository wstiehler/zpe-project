# folders

## Context and Problem Statement

### internal
'Given' that the application is private, we use the /internal/ folder to separate the code that should not be exposed to the external world, or in other words, almost all of our code resides in /internal/.

### infrastructure
All peripheral code related to the application, such as databases, external services, etc., is placed in /internal/infrastructure/.

### domain
All code representing the application's domain, business logic, and purpose, is located in /internal/domain/.
